# MedicationTracker

TL;DR: I told ya :-)

Toy Android app to track my after surgery eye drops. App is functional, but lacks visual polish and configuration possibilities. Medication names are hard-coded. Don't have high expectations :-)

This is one of my first Android applications, so don't try to look at the code for best practices, however you are free to fork the repository and play with it.
